Introduction
============

OCLC (OpenCL Compiler) provides a wrapper around
the OpenCL just-in-time compilation that allows
to create binary data that can be loaded using
clCreateProgramWithBinary.


Requirements
============

The code is writtin in C. You will need an OpenCL
implementation. OCLC has been tested only with the
NVIDIA OpenCL implementation.
The code uses GNU gengetopt which must be installed
and in the PATH.


Installation
============

Currently, one has to manually edit the Makefile.in
file to specify the C compiler and the include and
link flags for OpenCL. The build process produces
the oclc executable.


Known Problems
==============

No known bugs so far.
